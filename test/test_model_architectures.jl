#TODO - build a test which ensures the models are reconstructed and implemented correctly.
#Would read in a file which is saved from Python along with a test input and output from Python.
#Would parse the file, build the <:DataDrivenModelArchitecture component, and call the forward pass on the same input and verify the same output

#Should have a function FullyConnected("test_model.h5", "normalization_data") which constructs the model from saved files.
